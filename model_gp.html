		<br><h2>Introduction</h2><br>
 Web development simply is a course assigned for us to do tasks associated to develop and create a website for hosting through intranet or internet(World Wide Web). It is developed through coding and programming with presence of various web designing skills. This course helps us to increase our web development skills. As the first assignment of web development, we were given to design a personal website with atleast of 6 pages using HTML and CSS properties. The first page should be landing or introduction page which is also called home page. The second one should be About page where we should give a short description on ourselves mentioning the reason about our aspiration to be a web developer. Third one should be CV page where we are supposed to give our educational qualifications and other experiences.Another one is Social page and we are told to link our social sites in this page. Fifth one is Model_ gp page where you have to write all the detailed report of your assignment. The last one is Contact page which should include our location in google map and a contact form. We are also instructed to make the website mobile responsive as 60% of the users are mobile users nowadays. The main aim of this assignment is to check our web development skills which we have learnt and to make it more clear and understand the basic concept of web development <br>

  <br><h2>Experience</h2><br>
  When I joined the college, I got to know that Web development was one of the 6 courses which we need to study in the first year. I was very excited and nervous at the same time. The reason why I was happy is because, we all are familiar with different websites in our daily life and I was going to learn about the method and skills to create such websites. I was nervous because this was completely a new term for me and I thought it was very complex to make such attractive and user friendly websites.<br>
  <br>In the first week, we learned about the introduction of web development and designing and also learned about Github, which is a software development platform. After that we slowly went to the Basics of HTML and CSS and learnt to make a layout of website. We also got some idea about how HTML and CSS are linked to eachother. We also got idea about how to add image and usage of flex properties. We were also taught to add animation and make the webpage responsive. Every week, we were gaining more and more knowledge about web page developing.<br>
  <br>As this was my first time that I studying web development. So, I had a lots of problem to understand the concept at first. But, I never backed down. I had my supportive friends who were always there to help me out. Our tutors were so helpful during lectures and tutorials. They always assisted in making us learn some real webpage skills. They were very friendly and learning was very fun.<br>
  <br>At the end of first term, I noticed that I was able to make a webpage using HTML and CSS properties. I can now use flex properties, padding, animations, margin,images and many more to create a website. It was overall a very different experience in learning web development. With all of the things I've learnt in term 1, I was able to complete my first assignment. Lastly, learning web development made us creative as we have to use our own idea and creation to design a website. I had a very good experience in learning the web development and wish to do more better in the future.<br>

  <br><h2>How I did my Assignment</h2><br>
  When we were provided with the assignment of web developing, I had some difficulty in doing it. Although, I knew some basics of webpage development but it was something challenging for me. I had never done such kind of assignment before. I then started doing research on internet to get some ideas about how to start the assignment. I started the assignment but it was getting difficult for me to keep doing it. There was a lot of error in my pages. I couldn't make a error free pages. I then started to discuss with my friend circle about getting a clear concept on what I was going to do. They assisted me and gave me some suggestion to make a webpage with no error. It took some time for me to make a clean webpage. I was supposed to submit my assignment on 22nd April but I still had some problems in making my website responsive and still had some other CSS errors.  Due to this, I couldn't submit my assignment on time. I took some time more to complete it and decided to submit it lately. I know i am not getting more marks for late submission but I am clear about the basics of website. I have some web skills now. I cannot get good marks in this term as i submitted it late. Hopefully in the next assignment, I can get a good marks and learn many more about web development.<br>

  <br><h2>User Interface Design</h2><br>
  User Interface Design simply means the presentation of the website and how the website is made. It refers to the look and feel of the website. It also explains the interactivity of the design to the users. UI is very important in every website for users and visitors to get attracted towards it.<br>
  <br>I wanted a very clean and simple design for my websites. To get a positive feedback and attract users, I researched about templates of some websites. I wanted to keep a clean design so that it can be more user friendly and easy to access. I looked for those template which is eye friendly to the user and is not very complex as I was a fresh designer. I didn't tried to copy the whole template but I just want to take some idea about the design.<br>
  <br>As mobile is used by almost every individual nowadays because of its portability. People uses mobile to carry their maximum task. So, I decided to make my webpage mobile responsive which could satisfy the mobile users. Overall, I wanted to design my website in an effective manner so that user can experience a enjoyable surf of the website.<br>

  Here this was the form of template that I used for my contact page. I looked at the template and tried to make my contact page with some changes in it. It is a very simple template but a attractive one. It also contains a google location attached in it which is effective. So I decided to use this template for my contact page. <br>

  <br><h2>Wireframes</h2><br>
